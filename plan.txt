Use: https://geocode.xyz/api
API call: https://geocode.xyz/?locate=location&outputformat 
Plus Leaflet map
Perhaps look into using https://developers.google.com/maps

Perhaps have model state contain list of markers so can render many markers on the map and perhaps save to local storage.

Forward geocoding: place name into lat + long --> will probably use this and then use leaflet to display lat/long location on map


error in json format:
{ 
  "matches": null,
  "error": {
    "description": "15. Your request did not produce any results.",
    "code": "008"
  },
  "suggestion": {
    "region": "AU", 
    "locate": "9 11 DEODAR DRIVE BURLIEGH HEADS  4220 QLD "
  }
}

Running the suggestion back to the API with the region parameter (if defined) produces the correct response:
Example: https://geocode.xyz/9 11 DEODAR DRIVE BURLIEGH HEADS 4220 QLD?region=AU

Application logic: 
User looks up place:
gets info in sidebar + map marker
User can add markers for multiple locations. 
Use can view marker data for all locations
User can clear map markers and corresponding marker data
User can view places I've lived
User can remove last marker added or remove marker of choice
Settings to adjust zoom on marker click or add.
Future idea: make mobile responsive
