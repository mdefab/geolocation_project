Use: https://geocode.xyz/api
API call: https://geocode.xyz/?locate=location&outputformat 
Plus Leaflet map
Perhaps look into using https://developers.google.com/maps

Perhaps have model state contain list of markers so can render many markers on the map and perhaps save to local storage.

Forward geocoding: place name into lat + long --> will probably use this and then use leaflet to display lat/long location on map


error in json format:
{ 
  "matches": null,
  "error": {
    "description": "15. Your request did not produce any results.",
    "code": "008"
  },
  "suggestion": {
    "region": "AU", 
    "locate": "9 11 DEODAR DRIVE BURLIEGH HEADS  4220 QLD "
  }
}

Running the suggestion back to the API with the region parameter (if defined) produces the correct response:
Example: https://geocode.xyz/9 11 DEODAR DRIVE BURLIEGH HEADS 4220 QLD?region=AU

Application logic: 
User looks up place:
gets info in sidebar + map marker
User can add markers for multiple locations. (distance between locations api?)
User can clear map.

UI: add keydown event for pressing enter instead of button

Perhaps: create a button that displays all the places I've lived with some description. Create a csv file for that data.
