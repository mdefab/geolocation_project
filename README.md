[View my project on Netlify!](https://michaels-map-marker.netlify.app)

A simple geolocation app that allows the user to look up a location and it will output a marker on the map and
also gather the marker data into a list containing the city, country, lat/long coordinates of each marker.
The user can:
- add multiple marker locations. 
- view the data for all markers.
- clear all of the map markers or undo one marker at a time and it will remove the corresponding marker data
  from the side bar
- adjust the zoom levels on marker click and marker add.
The user can also view all the places I've lived with a pop up that includes a description of when I was there.


If you intend to use the code, you should acquire an api key from http://geocode.xyz/ and insert it as
an environment variable (API_KEY) in your .env file.
